# waveshare-display
*A C++ Waveshare WSLCD18 driver for the micro:bit v2.*

## Getting Started
This is a very in-progress project. There is currently no documentation on getting your display up and running (there's really nothing to show yet!)

## Build
This repository has an optional build dependency on [`micro-tools`](https://github.com/c272/micro-tools). The build guide below will assume that you have already installed and set up `micro-tools`.
```bash
microbuild
microflash
```
